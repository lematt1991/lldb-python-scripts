# lldb-python-scripts
This repository contains a number of Python scripts 
can be imported into LLDB.  Some of them are specific
to [Manticore](manticore.cs.uchicago.edu), but should be
able to be easily modified to suite other projects.


You can import all scripts within a file by default by 
creating a ".lldbinit" file in your home directory, that
contains the following line:

    command script import <path to commands.py>/commands.py
